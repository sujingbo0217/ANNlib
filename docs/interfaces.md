## Terminologies

Throughout the library, we use the following words with specific meanings in the code. Although you do not have to follow the same wording during your own development, reading this would help you better understand the code and memorize the interfaces. If you are contributing to this library, you are expected to use the names consistently.

- `point`
- `base points`
- `query`
- `index`
- `graph`
- `node`
- `edge`
- `neighbor`
- `connection`
- `hop`
- `distance`
